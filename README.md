# Description
We are creating a robot arm that is desighned to pick up sandwhiches. Our main "problemm" we are atteping to solve to to make the jobs of busy mothers easyer. Taking the stress of making sandwhiches off their shoulders by programming a robot arm to assemble and ingredients on a peice of bread. we intended to use potenchiamerters as a sort of turning dial to contol the movements of the robot. We will be making a ham and cheese sandwich instead of a peanut butter and jelly because the usage of knives and spoons to get out and spread the condiments as well as the condiments themselves, can be messy and sometimes even dangerous (the knife for the peanut butter). 

# posible solutions
Possible Solutions: We have a few possible solutions. One could be to not incorporate the arm piece at all and stick with the flippers. Another solution would be to simplify the complexity of the arms code allowing it to do a simple range of motions that would be preprogrammed. 

# possible designs
Possible designs:
Our first solution would be to not make a robotic arm, but a robot with flippers. Now these flippers would be spatulas that attach to the bottom of the robot’s armlike thing. We would have the flippers turn 180 degrees so that they essentially “flip” over the ham or cheese and deposit it onto the base piece of bread. The  spatula design would also be able to slide under the ham or cheese to pick it up and then be able to transport it. Having one appendage would be more simple than having many, and would save us time on code and cad work. The one appendage with the spatula would have servos and motors that allow it to turn and move up and down as well from left to right so it can move and put things in their specific spot. 

# chosen designh
Chosen Design:
A single arm, with condiments in front of the arm on specific spots dedicated to each condiment aka. Ham, cheese, lettuce. The claw will open and close, turn directions on how it grabs the condiment aka down or sideways. The arm will turn and drop the condiment on the bread, making the arm turn a little more over each time to reach the next condiment. If we choose to make 2 sandwiches, then we can move the arm 180 degrees and do the same thing on the other side of the base.

Time Schedule
Week 1: (11/23-12/3)
 have a general idea of what we need to learn in order for this project to work, and have brainstormed and tried to troubleshoot. 
Week 2: (12/4-12/17)
Finish planning and start on prototype and proof
Week 3: (1/3-1/17)
Continue and hopefully finish prototype and proof, look at code a little
Week 4: (1/18-2/10)
Have a prototype made and make code to have the arm moving up and down along with opening and closing the hanger bay. 
Week 5: (2/11-2/14)
Make an engineering notebook (or continue updating throughout the project)and have images and videos as well as code and information to upload and present our project through github.
