# Description
We are creating a robot arm that is desighned to pick up sandwhiches. Our main "problemm" we are atteping to solve to to make the jobs of busy mothers easyer. Taking the stress of making sandwhiches off their shoulders by programming a robot arm to assemble and ingredients on a peice of bread. we intended to use potenchiamerters as a sort of turning dial to contol the movements of the robot. We will be making a ham and cheese sandwich instead of a peanut butter and jelly because the usage of knives and spoons to get out and spread the condiments as well as the condiments themselves, can be messy and sometimes even dangerous (the knife for the peanut butter). 

# chosen design
Chosen Design:
A single arm, with condiments in front of the arm on specific spots dedicated to each condiment aka. Ham, cheese, lettuce. The claw will open and close, turn directions on how it grabs the condiment aka down or sideways. The arm will turn and drop the condiment on the bread, making the arm turn a little more over each time to reach the next condiment. If we choose to make 2 sandwiches, then we can move the arm 180 degrees and do the same thing on the other side of the base.

# schedule
Time Schedule
Week 1: (11/23-12/3)
 have a general idea of what we need to learn in order for this project to work, and have brainstormed and tried to troubleshoot. 
Week 2: (12/4-12/17)
Finish planning and start on prototype and proof
Week 3: (1/3-1/17)
Continue and hopefully finish prototype and proof, look at code a little
Week 4: (1/18-2/10)
Have a prototype made and make code to have the arm moving up and down along with opening and closing the hanger bay. 
Week 5: (2/11-2/14)
Make an engineering notebook (or continue updating throughout the project)and have images and videos as well as code and information to upload and present our project through github. 

# Onshape Parts
1) In this picture you can see the many different parts in the making. Some of the shapes were imported from the public library in onshape and others were handmade by Ellen Lynch.
2) This photo is compiled of all of the parts that will be included in our assembly

# Base
1) This stand will hold the upper half of the robot along with the servos, bolts, screws, and acrylic peices of the robot arms
2) Basically this is the base for our project so a lot of effort has to be put into this
3) The hole was cut to save space and be used to hold up the servos 
4) We took parts from the public github library to save time

# Bread Board
1) The bread baord hold the wires that give power to the multiple potentiameters that will be hooked up
2) Without a bread board we would only be able to hook up the potentiamter 
3) The bread board holds a negitive and positive outlet that allows for multiple connections
